## The MemProtMD API
The MemProtMD API connects the MemProtMD database to applications such
as this site. The API is free to use for any application, provided data
obtained through it is properly attributed.

### General notes
We recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to check that
the API methods shown here behave as expected. Postman can also output
code snippets in a number of languages for pipeline applications. examples
in this guide use Python's Requests library.

### User guide
Currently we provide a reference implementation as a Jupyter notebook. If
you make something better or more user friendly, make a pull request and
we'll be eternally grateful.
